# The Article Site - Demo Project

This web app, developed with the React.js framework, implements a blog with features such as authentication, user registration with permission control (user, editor and administrator), search by text and tags, likes and marking preferred posts. There is an administrative area where users with the permission have access. It uses a Rest API created with Node.js and MongoDB database.
